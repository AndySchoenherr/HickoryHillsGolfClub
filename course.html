        <p class="course_long">Hickory Hills is a challenging nine hole course located in scenic, rolling hills less than a mile southwest of Brownstown, Indiana on State Road 135. 

The par 70 course plays a total of 6,250 yards from the championship tees, 5,720 yards from the men's regular tees and 4,690 yards from the ladie's tees for 18 holes. 
The course/slope ratings are 66.2/101 for the men's #1 white tees, 68.1/106 for the men's #2 blue, 65.8/97 for the ladie's #1 red tees and 71.1/109 for the ladie's #2 white. 

The fairways are sown with a beautiful carpet of 'Zoysia grass' which provides a very fine surface from which every level of player can make the most of their shot-making abilities. 

Be forewarned; however, the greens at Hickory Hills are famous for their speed and deceptive breaks. 

Hickory Hills features a completely new clubhouse and golf shop built in 2000. 

Our golf club is semi-private and membership owned. This allows us to keep costs low providing the golfing public the best experience possible at reasonable prices. 

Moreover, the most outstanding amenity offered by Hickory Hills Golf Club is its casual, convivial, family-oriented atmosphere. 

We wholeheartedly invite you and your family to join us for a round today.

        <p class="holes">Number one is a par 4 measuring 455 yards from the blues, 440 yards from the whites and 315 from the red tees. 

Handicapped 1 for men and 2 for women. 

Out of bounds - fence left. 

A gently rolling, slight dog-leg left, number one was originally a par five and remains the longest hole on the course from the white tees. 

A row of mature pines along the left side of the fairway provides ample trouble for those prone to hook the ball. Additionally, a row of immature deciduous trees inside the pines not only narrows the fairway, but offers more problems for left hitting players. 

The green lies low behind a small rise which tends to 'throw' the ball across the green if hit short. Sloping from back to front, it has many deceptive breaks and a bunker lies to the left. 

The main challenge for golfers of all levels is number one's length and the numerous trees along the left side. Higher handicapped golfers may wish to attack this hole as if it were still a par five.</p><br>

			<p class="holes" ><img src="images/hole2.png" class="holepic">Number two is a par 4 measuring 386 yards from the blue tees, 361 yards from the whites and 298 from the reds. 

Handicapped 5 for men and 4 for women. 

Out of bounds - white stakes left. 

Number two, a gentle, dog-leg left, features a high, 'saddle' shaped hill cresting two hundred and eleven yards from the white tees. 

The entire left side of the fairway is bounded by a farmer's field proffering a lost ball for those that hit too far left. 

The deep, narrow green lies well below the crest of the saddle 150 yards out. The back slope of this hill can make for formidable downhill lies all the way to the 100 yard marker. 

Bunkered to the right front and right, a well placed approach has a good chance of staying on the green; however, shots errant to the left or right will more than likely leave the golfer with a difficult chip to the very narrow green. 

Novice players may wish to play this hole 'left' to avoid the hazards found on the right side of the green.</p><br>

            Number three is a par 5 measuring 465 yards from the blues, 429 yards from the white tees and 375 from the reds. 

Handicapped 3 for men and 1 for women. 

Out of bounds - white stakes left. 

The first two hundred and seventy-nine yards of number three are bounded by dense woods on the left and a row of trees to the right. The final 150 yards narrows dramatically from the creek with dense woods encroaching on the left and thick woods running in from the right. 

This narrow, wooded 'alley' leading rather steeply uphill to the wildly undulating green challenges golfers to place their drives in the center of the fairway to ease the angle of their second shot toward the green. 

Golfers wanting to avoid a steep downhill putt may be tempted to play their approach to the right, but be forewarned that such shots may well end up in the deep bunker guarding the right of the green. 
            </p><br>
            
            <p class="holes" ><img src="images/hole4.png" class="holepic">
            Number four is a par 3 measuring 172 yards from the blues, 140 from the whites and 64 yards from the red tees. 

Handicapped 9 for both men and women. 

Number four green lies well below the men's tees and is backed by a steep hill leading up to the number 7 teebox. 

Despite its short length and 9th handicap rating, number four challenges with a narrow shot across both water and sand to a shallow green that slopes quickly from back to front and center to left leaving little opportunity to 'stick it' tight for any but the better players. 

Number four is a beautiful hole with a fountain dancing the waters of its lake, and is considered by all as the "signature hole" of Hickory Hills Golf Club. 

            </p><br>
            
            <p class="holes" ><img src="images/hole5.png" class="holepic">
            Number five is a par 4 measuring 315 yards from the blue tees, 282 from the whites and 282 yards from the reds. 

Handicapped 7 for both men and women. 

Number five, known affectionatly as "Teflon Hill," is a short, straightaway par 4 running downhill and sloping to the right from the teebox before rising the last 125 yards to a domed green offering little flat space to land one's approach. 

The greatest challenge to an easy par is the domed nature of the green which sits atop a steep hill guarded on the front right by sand and on the right by a grass bunker. 

Players wishing to avoid the bunkers risk finding their ball rolling off the steep left side of the green and down the very steep left side of the hill to end on the cartpath siding number six teebox. 

Those unfortunate enough to find themselves in this situation face a long uphill chip/pitch to a slick green running away to either the sand or grass bunkers.

            <p class="holes" ><img src="images/hole6.png" class="holepic">
            
Number six is a par 4 measuring 394 yards from the blues, 344 from the white tees and 286 yards from the reds. 

Handicapped 6 for men and 5 for women. 

The sixth hole has a rolling fairway, and offers an excellent opportunity to score well if one can keep the ball off the steep hill bounding most of the right side. 

The green is generous and breaks smoothly to the right and front. Twin bunkers are located to the left front and left of the green. 

Danger is found if one's approach is long. Behind the green are steep hills leading down to number seven's teebox. Golfers finding number seven tee will face a long uphill pitch over mature pines growing well up the slope leading back to the green.

            <p class="holes" ><img src="images/hole7.png" class="holepic">
            Number seven is a par 3 measuring 170 yards from the blue tees, 126 from the whites and 126 yards from the reds. 

Handicapped 8 for both men and women. 

Out of bounds - fence behind green. 

A nice, tight and seemingly simple par 3, number seven can challenge with more than its small, very fast green.

Golfers are warned not to drift too far left, right or long on number seven. 

Numerous pines and a steep hill leading to the lake can be found on the left. 

Trees and an undulating rough located on a steep hill will hurt those landing on the right. 

Finally, sparse, needle strewn grass punctuated with large, exposed roots will punish those found off the back of the green.

            <p class="holes" ><img src="images/hole8.png" class="holepic">
            Number eight is a par 4 measuring 378 yards from the blue tees, 363 from the whites and 317 yards from the red tees. 

Handicapped 4 for men and 3 for women. 

A dog-leg left, number eight features a deep valley between the tee and green which reaches its lowest point 213 yards from the white tees. 

The approach to eight green for most players will be a blind, uphill shot to the green located below the far side of the hill. 

Sand guards the right front of the green and a deep grass bunker is found right of the green. 

Steep hills run off the green to the left, right and rear. 

Those that find themselves short off the tee are cautioned against "The Auggies" a wooded thicket that occupies a 'cliff' right of the last 100 yards of the fairway and infamous for lost balls.
            </p><br>
            
            <p class="holes" ><img src="images/hole9.png" class="holepic">
            Number nine is a par 4 measuring 390 yards from the blue tees, 375 from the whites and 282 yards from the red tees. 

Handicapped 2 for men and 6 for women. 

With a slight dog-leg left, number nine stymies many golfers with a hill cresting 220 yards from the white tees. 

Approach shots to an expansive green tend to play one club longer than the distance indicates. 

The green is guarded on the right by sand and the rear of the green is shielded with dense pines. 

Deceptive breaks and a fast back to front slope can cause putts to be more difficult than first anticipated. 

This hole has a tough reputation that epitomizes the axiom, "Don't judge a book by its cover."
